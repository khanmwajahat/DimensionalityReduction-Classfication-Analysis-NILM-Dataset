# DimensionalityReduction-Classfication-Analysis-NILM-Dataset
In this dimensionality reduction and Classification is performed on the NILM Dataset. The following combinations have been tried out:

1) Classification using Partial Least Regression
2) Classification using MultiLayerPerceptron and Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis
3) Classification using Decision Trees and Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis
4) Classification using Linear Discriminant Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis
5) Classification using Decision Trees and Dimensionality Reduction using Backwards Elimination
6) Classification using Linear Discriminant Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction using Backwards Elimination
